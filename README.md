# REAKTOR Driver

The driver for the REAKTOR test vehicle.

This repository is structured into three main components:
- **driver** The Arduino project that controls the driver board interacting with the hardware.
- **connector** The Python module with a low-level API for communicating with the *driver* via serial connection.
- **definitions** Central definitions and configurations for both main components.
